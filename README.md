# Nutrient-Analyzer-
This bot is designed to traverse a farm, measure essential nutrient values including Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K), and provide actionable insights to the farmer.
# Problem
Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK) are three essential nutrients crucial for the growth of most crops. Fertilizers used by farmers primarily contain these elements to enhance crop growth. For optimal yield, these nutrients must be present in the soil in precise proportions. However, many farmers do not regularly monitor or analyze their soil, which means they may not know the exact fertilizer requirements. To address this issue, we propose a soil nutrient monitoring robot that analyzes the soil and provides detailed feedback on the current and ideal concentrations of NPK levels.
# Abstract
The proposed soil nutrient monitoring robot is designed to navigate the entire farm, systematically gathering data. As it moves through a designated area, it will periodically stop at set intervals. At each stop, an NPK sensor will make contact with the soil to measure nutrient levels. After each measurement, the robot will resume its path, repeating this process until the whole farm has been covered. The data collected will be stored in a database, and the average levels of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium will be calculated. Based on these measurements, the precise amount of fertilizer needed to achieve optimal nutrient levels can be determined and applied accordingly.
