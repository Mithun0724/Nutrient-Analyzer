# Nutrient-Analyzer-
This bot is designed to traverse a farm, measure essential nutrient values including Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K), and provide actionable insights to the farmer.
# Problem
Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK) are three essential nutrients crucial for the growth of most crops. Fertilizers used by farmers primarily contain these elements to enhance crop growth. For optimal yield, these nutrients must be present in the soil in precise proportions. However, many farmers do not regularly monitor or analyze their soil, which means they may not know the exact fertilizer requirements. To address this issue, we propose a soil nutrient monitoring robot that analyzes the soil and provides detailed feedback on the current and ideal concentrations of NPK levels.
# Abstract
The proposed soil nutrient monitoring robot is designed to navigate the entire farm, systematically gathering data. As it moves through a designated area, it will periodically stop at set intervals. At each stop, an NPK sensor will make contact with the soil to measure nutrient levels. After each measurement, the robot will resume its path, repeating this process until the whole farm has been covered. The data collected will be stored in a database, and the average levels of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium will be calculated. Based on these measurements, the precise amount of fertilizer needed to achieve optimal nutrient levels can be determined and applied accordingly.

# Future Scope
Our team has developed a rudimentary prototype that can be scaled up by creating more robust and reliable designs for broader agricultural applications. The robot's functionality can be expanded to monitor non-essential nutrients, water depth, soil pH levels, and detect the presence of excessive inorganic fertilizers and pesticides. Future versions could also be automated to minimize human effort and streamline the entire monitoring process.
# Conclusion
In conclusion, our robot is capable of assessing soil nutrient levels and displaying the values on a monitor. It can also analyze and display soil moisture content. During the development of our prototype, we observed that the robot effectively analyzed soil moisture levels and displayed the results. The robot remains operational for a minute before it moves to a new location to repeat the process.
